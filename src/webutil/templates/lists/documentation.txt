In the this directory the files for the to be asssembled lists are stored.
Unlike in the other templates folder these files combine previously defined Elements to one Html Structure.
The defined Elements are taken as a whole from files. 
For example the Content defined in ../forms/reply.hbs is at compile time inserted into the show_issue.hbs list file.
